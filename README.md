# Stepper
## Show number of steps taken on lockscreen/statusbar

### Intro
Stepper is a jailbreak extension for iOS that allows the user to show the number of steps taken in a specific time period on the lockscreen and/or the statusbar.

### How do I Stepper?
Just install the tweak and after the respring grant 'StepperApp' access to motion data. In the settings you have many options to customize the look and the functionality of Stepper.

Note: Since this tweak fetches data from the M7, it's iPhone 5s only.

### How do I get?
Compile it for yourself, use the .deb included or buy it in the Cydia Store for just one dollar.

### How do I compile?
You should know that. :P

### License?
Pretty much the BSD license, just don't repackage it and call it your own please!

Also if you do make some changes, feel free to make a pull request and help make things more awesome!
